Now this Swiss-Italian seafaring family are fulfilling their life-long dream and launching Explora Journeys, an exquisite, modern luxury cruise experience like no other. Explora Journeys represents the ambition and long-held dream of the MSC Group and the Aponte family to create a transformative luxury ocean travel experience and brand that redefines the luxury cruise category. Inspired by the sea The Aponte family records date back to the 17th century from which 300 years of sea-faring expertise, alongside an inherent passion and respect for the sea has developed. This has carried through generations of the Aponte family and will do so into the future. It is why the ocean will always remain at the forefront of the Explora Journeys experience, allowing curious, cosmopolitan travellers to harness its unique energy which in turn inspires inner and outer discovery. Itineraries hand-picked by the Aponte Family Fast forwarding to the twenty-twenties, the Aponte family embarked on a mission to create a unique and relaxed yacht experience that combines cosmopolitan energy with a sense of feeling at home. Explora Journeys, their venture, offers itineraries based on the family's own travel experiences and dream destinations. Their intimate knowledge ensures guests have access to the best places to visit, dine, and experience, with an unwavering commitment to authenticity in cuisine, experiences, village charm, and natural beauty.

This is Napoleon\u2019s birthplace, so beeline the old town\u2019s charming narrow streets to Maison Bonaparte, the family home and now a museum, and Baroque cathedral where he was baptised in the marble font. Meander markets popular with foodies seeking local winemakers, olive oil, chestnuts and cheeses, and kick back on white sands in the beautiful Bay of Ajaccio with views of the Genoese tower on the Parata Peninsula and rust-coloured Sanguinaire islands beyond.

See and be seen in pretty Piazzetta de Porto Cervo then give thanks for your good fortune at the sweet Stella Maris cathedral. Pop into Poltu Quatu, the fanciest spot on the coast or delve into history at \u201cGiants\u2019 Graves\u201d which proves Porto has been a sanctuary since the Stone Age.
